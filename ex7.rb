# Exercise 7
# More Printing

puts "Mary had a little lamb."
puts "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
puts "." * 10 # multiplies the character string "." by the integer 10

end1 = "C"

end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"

#notice how we are using print instead of puts here. change it is 
# puts and see what happens.
# A: using puts instead displays the completed string, but breaks where the line breaks. Print ignores new lines?
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10  
print end11 + end12 + end1 + end2 + end3 + 
end4 + end5 + end6


 # this just is polite use of the terminal, try removing it
puts
# leaving this in results in a printed line with no characters in it, and empty space.  Easier to read the next line / terminal command
