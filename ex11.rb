# Chaing it.

print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp()
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp()
print "How much do you weigh? "
weight = gets.chomp()

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} lbs."
puts
#print "How do you feel about being asked your weight? (fine, angry)"
#reaction = gets.chomp()
#if reaction = ("fine") then
#puts "whatever"
#else 
#puts "You feel #{reaction} because you too self-conscious about unimportant things."

# Don't know what the syntax for an if/else argument should look like"

print "What religion do you identify most with?"
religion = gets.chomp()
print "Do you consider yourself a good person?"
morals = gets.chomp()
print "Does your conscious allow you to sleep at night?"
conscious = gets.chomp()

puts "I understand hat you feel you are a #{religion}."
puts "Regardless of how you feel about #{religion} and whether or not you feel #{morals} about yourself, you shouldn't think you are a good person."
